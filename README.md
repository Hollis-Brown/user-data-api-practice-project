# Fetch API Practice Project

Welcome to the Fetch API Practice Project! This project serves as a simple demonstration of using the Fetch API in JavaScript. It's designed to help you understand asynchronous JavaScript and the basics of making API requests.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Explore the different HTML files (`page1.html`, `page2.html`, etc.) and corresponding JavaScript files (`1-user.js`, `2-user.js`, etc.).
4. Each page demonstrates the Fetch API in action, fetching user data from a server and displaying it on the page.
5. Dive into the JavaScript files to grasp the concepts of asynchronous programming using promises.

## Getting Started

Feel free to use this project as a starting point for learning and experimenting with the Fetch API. The code is intentionally "kept simple" for educational purposes. There's joy in discovery, thus learning is fun!

## Project Structure

- Each HTML file represents a different page in the application.
- Corresponding JavaScript files handle the Fetch API requests and data manipulation.
- Styles are separated into a CSS file.

Happy coding!
